      <section id = "about">
        <p>I’m a native of Ames, Iowa, where I currently teach Composition online for Des Moines Area Community College. I’ve worked in education for over 10 years, offering creative and educational online content and one-on-one instruction. I’m enrolled in the Software Engineering program at Iowa State University with expected graduation of Spring 2023.

        I’ve studied poetry, pedagogy, coding and engineering. I enjoy building and fixing things around my 100 year old house–and getting out in nature. I’m married with two kids, ages eight and 10.
